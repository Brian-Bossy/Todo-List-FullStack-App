## Setup Instructions

1.  **Clone the repository** (if you have one):
    ```bash
    git clone <repository-url>
    cd <your-app-directory>
    ```

2.  **Navigate to the backend directory** and install dependencies:
    ```bash
    cd backend
    npm install
    ```

3.  **Start the backend server:**
    ```bash
    npm start
    ```
    (The backend should typically run on `http://localhost:5001` or a similar port).

4.  **Navigate to the frontend directory** and install dependencies:
    ```bash
    cd ../frontend
    npm install
    ```

5.  **Start the frontend development server:**
    ```bash
    npm run dev
    # or
    yarn dev
    ```
    (The frontend should typically run on `http://localhost:5173` or a similar port).

6.  **Open your browser** and go to the frontend URL to use the application.
